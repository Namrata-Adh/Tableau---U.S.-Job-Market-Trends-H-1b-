# Tableau-U.S.-Job-Market-Trends

I completed a Tableau project analyzing H-1B visa sponsorship trends among U.S. employers from 2017 to 2022. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and USCIS, was used to uncover key insights into visa sponsorship patterns, highlighting the top employers, job categories, and trends over time. This project allowed me to utilize data visualization techniques to present the findings effectively.
